# DreamSpace Studio
Rapid Web Application Development using NodeJS.  The main idea is to be able to load the one studio page and begin developing using TypeScript - all from the front end! (and without need to constantly compile and run).

I started this project some years back when Silverlight no longer had a bright future with the intent of providing a powerful replacement. I decided to use TypeScript on the front end but found it too limiting and shelved the idea until TypewScript matured.  Now that TypeScript has come a long way, and we now have an official editor (Monaco!) I've decided to give this another go.

Stay tuned...
